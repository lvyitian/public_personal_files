If anyone NEEDS to continue running beta for fear or projects not opening in the newest Live 12 or for whatever reason.

    Look up a program called RunAsDate
    Start RunAsDate.exe as admin
    Browse to your exe for Live12 beta (C:\ProgramData\Ableton\Live 12 Beta\Program)
    Set date to any date before 4/1/2024
    Create a name for new shortcut next to Create Desktop Shortcut
    Click Create Desktop Shortcut

Launch Live 12 beta using the newly created shortcut and you should be okay.
